Sanity Check [Weighted] [O]ver[L]ap [A]dd in [P]artitions 
==============================

This project demonstrates how to use the C++ WOLAP-Class, it uses Qt for visualization (so you need Qt libraries to build it). There is also a MATLAB subfolder which shows how to implement WOLAP there. Tha MATLAB-examples are not encapsulated, so you have to do this on your own.


Build
-----

Run Cmake without errors and build with your favourite compiler.


Functionality
------------

The .exe shows an example processing of the WOLAP-class. A rectangular wave is convolved with an inverse, delayed, decayed sine as impulse response. Tha MATLAB-example ``testWOLAP.m`` shows the same processing, and the ``sanityCheckWOLAP.m`` performs a real time processing of synthetic, time-variant impulse-responses with a music signal (hotelCaliforniaSnippet.wav).
