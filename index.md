## Audio files

In this scene the position of the audio source is switched with 4 different techniques. 

First OLA, with its switching artefacts:
<audio src="/FirstGHPage//assets/audio/cello_C3_phrase_cresc-decresc_arco-normal_OLA.wav" controls title="Cello processed by OLA"></audio>

Second OLS, with its switching artefacts:
<audio src="/FirstGHPage/assets/audio/cello_C3_phrase_cresc-decresc_arco-normal_OLS.wav" controls title="Cello processed by OLS"></audio>

Third WOLA, with its slow transition:
<audio src="/FirstGHPage/assets/audio/cello_C3_phrase_cresc-decresc_arco-normal_WOLA.wav" controls title="Cello processed by WOLA"></audio>

Finally, TVOLAP (proposed), no artefacts and very responsive switching.
